US President Donald Trump imposed an additional<span style=" color:red"> 25% tariff on Indian imports</span>  on the top of an already existing 25% duty, pushing the total to 50%.
These high tariffs, announced on August 6, would take effect from August 27.
The pharmaceutical sector, however, received a temporary exemption from the tariff hike, highlighting India’s crucial role in ensuring affordable access to medicines for millions of Americans.
Responding to the development, the Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil) said the exemption reinforces India’s position as a vital player in global healthcare.
“Tariffs on Indian pharma would be counterproductive, ultimately burdening American consumers.
Indian companies manufacture low-cost generics—not high-margin products—so any tariff costs would pass directly to US consumers,” Pharmexcil chairman Namit Joshi said in a statement quoted by PTI.
The US gets over 40% of generic medicines from India. 
These include vital treatments for cancer, chronic illnesses, and infectious diseases.
Joshi further warned that attempting to replicate India’s pharmaceutical infrastructure would take at least 3 to 5 years and come with major hurdles in scale, cost-effectiveness, and skilled manpower.
